**Weakest point:** [Vulnerability]

### Middle Position (Source 2)
**Core belief:** [Balanced view]
**Reasoning:** [Why they believe it]
**Strongest point:** [Best argument]
**Weakest point:** [Vulnerability]

### Position B (Source 3)
**Core belief:** [Opposite extreme]
**Reasoning:** [Why they believe it]  
**Strongest point:** [Best argument]
**Weakest point:** [Vulnerability]

## My Position
After reviewing all perspectives:
[Where you land on spectrum and why]

## Evolution Over Time Matrix

When tracking how understanding of a topic evolved:

```markdown
# Evolution of Thought: [Topic]

| Period | Representative Source | Key Insight | What Changed Next |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Era 1] | [Source/Author] | [Prevailing view] | [Paradigm shift] |
| [Era 2] | [Source/Author] | [New understanding] | [Next shift] |
| [Era 3] | [Source/Author] | [Current view] | [Open questions] |

## Pattern Analysis
**What stayed constant:** [Enduring truths]
**What repeatedly changed:** [Unstable assumptions]
**Current frontier:** [What we're figuring out now]

## Lessons from History
- [Historical pattern 1 and implication]
- [Historical pattern 2 and implication]
```

## Interdisciplinary Comparison

When same topic is analyzed from different fields:

```markdown
# Multi-Disciplinary View: [Topic]

| Discipline | Source | Core Question | Key Findings | Limitations |
|------------|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Economics | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |
| Psychology | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |
| Sociology | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |
| Biology | [Source] | [Question] | [Insight] | [Blind spot] |

## Synthesis
**Complementary insights:**
- Economics sees [X], Psychology explains [Y], together they reveal [Z]

**Contradictions:**
- [Field A] assumes [X], but [Field B] shows [not-X]
- Resolution: [How to reconcile]

**Blind spots filled:**
- Economics misses [X] that Sociology provides
- Psychology overlooks [Y] that Biology explains

## Integrated Model
[Diagram or description combining multiple lenses]
```

## Practical Comparison

For how-to content from multiple sources:

```markdown
# Implementation Comparison: [Skill/Method]

## Common Steps (All Sources Agree)
1. [Universally recommended step]
2. [Universally recommended step]

## Conflict Resolution Template

When sources directly contradict:

```markdown
# Resolving Contradiction: [Specific Claim]

## The Contradiction
**Source 1 claims:** [Statement]
**Source 2 claims:** [Opposite statement]

## Investigating the Conflict

### Possible Reasons for Disagreement

1. **Different Definitions**
   - Does Source 1 define [term] as [X]?
   - Does Source 2 define [term] as [Y]?
   - → Not actually contradicting if talking about different things

2. **Different Contexts**
   - Source 1 context: [Time/place/population]
   - Source 2 context: [Time/place/population]
   - → Both could be right in their contexts

3. **Different Evidence**
   - Source 1 relies on: [Evidence type]
   - Source 2 relies on: [Evidence type]
   - → Quality difference explains disagreement

4. **Different Values/Goals**
   - Source 1 optimizes for: [Goal]
   - Source 2 optimizes for: [Goal]
   - → Different priorities lead to different conclusions

5. **One is Wrong**
   - [Analysis of which source has flawed reasoning]

### Resolution
[Which source is more reliable for this specific claim and why]
OR
[How both can be true depending on context]
OR
[This remains unresolved; need more evidence]
```

## Usage Guidelines

**When to use comparison matrices:**
- Reading 3+ sources on same topic
- Encountering conflicting information
- Trying to synthesize best practices
- Building comprehensive understanding
- Making informed decisions

**How to populate:**
1. Read each source independently first (use standard note template)
2. Identify common themes/questions across sources
3. Create matrix structure based on what you're comparing
4. Fill in each source's position
5. Analyze patterns and synthesize

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Forcing false equivalence (not all views equally valid)
- ❌ Cherry-picking to support predetermined view
- ❌ Ignoring publication quality/expertise differences
- ❌ Missing the forest for the trees (over-detailed comparison)

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Weight sources by credibility
- ✅ Look for convergent evidence
- ✅ Note what's settled vs. debated
- ✅ Identify your own biases in interpretation
